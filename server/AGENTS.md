# Agent Guide —  Score my recipe backend

---


## Project instructions

Ensure you read the [global AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md),
this file adds specific instructions for the backend part.

## Bootstrap

Run these commands in order every time you start work in a fresh environment:

```bash
cd server  # if you start from the project folder
pip install uv
uv sync
```

---

## Key Commands

| Command       | Purpose                                     | Approx. time       |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `uv run uvicorn api.api.app --reload`       | Start server |  |
| `uv run pytest -v` | Run tests | ~20s        |

> External API calls to OpenFoodFacts will fail in sandboxed environments — this is expected. Focus on UI and code correctness.

---

## Pre-PR Validation (mandatory)

Before opening any pull request, run all of the following and fix every error:

```bash
uv run pytest -v
```

No PR should be opened with errors.

## Coding style

Always add a meaningful doc string to functions, modules, etc.

Add comments for complex parts or to justify non-intuitive choices, or to summarize long code chunks (so that reader can quickly get an overview of the code). Still try not to be too verbose (find the right balance). If you use advanced features (that not many programmers might know), add a link to the documentation in the comment.

When you comment, put line breaks at points that make sense for understanding (to optimize next git diff if comment is amended).

Try to make the code as clear as possible, by normalizing cases before processing, using the single responsibility pattern.

We try to use the frameworks at their best to have easy to read, semantic code. Especially Pydantic / FastAPI / pytest.
---

## Always add tests

Always add tests to the code you generate.
Think about edge cases.

Still try to keep the tests easy to maintain. As for code, add comments to help reader (see coding style).

## Integration tests (e2e)

The end-to-end suite lives in `e2e/` (Playwright) and starts this backend via
`tests/integration_server.py`. That entrypoint patches `api.recipes.off.parse_text`
with a recorded fixture and points `SCORE_MY_RECIPE_CACHE_DIR` at the pinned
taxonomy snapshots in `tests/data/taxonomies/`, so the whole stack runs offline.

To refresh the pinned data (network required):

```bash
# Refresh taxonomy snapshots
bash tests/data/update_taxonomies.sh

# Re-capture the parse_text fixture
uv run python tests/data/capture_parse_text.py
```

If the pinned green-score letter grade changes after a refresh, update
`EXPECTED_LETTER_GRADE` in `e2e/tests/recipe-score.spec.ts` after verifying the
new score is correct.
